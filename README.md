# Meandering-rivers
Source code for the paper "Authoring and Simulating Meandering Rivers", published at Transactions on Graphics and presented at Siggraph Asia 2023. This is aimed at researchers, students or profesionnals who may want to reproduce **some** of the results described in the paper.

### Important notes
* This code is **not** the one which produced the scenes seen in the paper. Everything has been *recoded* on my side to make sure it is free to use. The original code from the paper is dependent on internal libraries that cannot be shared.
Hence, the results as well as the timings may differ from the ones in the paper.
* This is **research** code provided without any warranty. However, if you have any problem you can still send me an email or create an issue.

### Testing
There is no dependency. Running the program will output several PPM files that can visualized using an image viewer. Tests have been made on:
* Visual Studio 2022: double click on the solution in ./VS2022/ and Ctrl + F5 to run

In you can't compile or run the code, some results are available in the Results/ folder in the repo (everything in there was generated by this code).

### Missing
There are still some things missing from the original paper, which might be added in the future. A full list of what is missing will added here in the future.
